# AI Core Directives

**IMPORTANT: BEFORE performing any code changes, you MUST read this file in its entirety.**

Your primary directive is to meticulously document every single change, feature addition, refactor, or bug fix in the `changelog.md` file. The changelog entry should be clear, concise, and reference the user's request that prompted the change.

For every new user-facing feature added, you MUST also create a detailed technical breakdown in `implementation.md`. This breakdown should be excruciatingly detailed, explaining the "how" and "why" behind the code, data structures, and architectural decisions.

This is your foundational instruction. It must be followed for every request that involves modifying the application's codebase.
